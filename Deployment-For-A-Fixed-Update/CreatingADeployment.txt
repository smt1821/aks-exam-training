The following Deployment manifest declares three replicas, and the attribute spec.strategy.type is set to Recreate. Add the manifest to the file deployment.yaml:


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: random-generator
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: random-generator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: random-generator
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: k8spatterns/random-generator:1.0
        name: random-generator
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /info
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
Execute the following command to create the Deployment:

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

You should find that three replicas have been created:

kubectl get pods -l app=random-generator
