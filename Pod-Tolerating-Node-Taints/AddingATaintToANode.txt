Run the following command to inspect taints of the worker node named node01:

kubectl describe node node01 | grep "Taints"

Our node starts out without any taints, and thus the command renders the following output:

Taints:             <none>
A taint with the key node-role.kubernetes.io/worker can be added to the node by using the following command. This marks the node as unschedulable except when a Pod tolerates the taint:

kubectl taint node node01 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker="true":NoSchedule

Verify that the taint has been added properly:

kubectl describe node node01 | grep "Taints"

This command will render the following output:

Taints:             node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=true:NoSchedule
