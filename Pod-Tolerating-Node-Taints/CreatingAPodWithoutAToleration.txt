The following manifest defines a Pod without tolerations. Add it to pod.yaml:


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: random-generator
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8spatterns/random-generator:1.0
    name: random-generator
Create the Pod object from the YAML manifest:

kubectl apply -f pod.yaml

You will find that the Pod cannot be scheduled, as it doesn't provide the toleration for node01. The Pod waits in the Pending status:

kubectl get pod random-generator
